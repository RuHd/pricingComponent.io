# Frontend Mentor - Pricing component with toggle

![Design preview for the Pricing component with toggle coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)


Here's the solution for the challenge from Frontend Mentor. As usual, it took a while to solve it. Not because was too hard, but I think I "hardcoded" on this one. But it was fun as usual, Hope you all enjoy it! :)
Any suggestions and feedbacks, please send me a message on my Frontend Mentor profile, I'd be glad!
